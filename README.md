# Quantum-Native-Magnetism
A repository for performing quantum-native scientific computing for atomistic and nanoscale magnetism studies. Created by Onri Jay Benally.

The following techniques are at least eligible for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing systems for quantum-native magnetic modeling:

```
- Thermofield-Double State (purified Gibbs state, VQE and VQS-based, NISQ and Near-Term Quantum) 
- Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) (finite-temperature/ground-state prep, NISQ) 
- Stochastic Schrödinger‑equation discretizations for a few modes (QSDE prototype, NISQ) 
- Quantum Trajectory (NISQ and Near-Term Quantum) 
- Short-Depth Trotter (NISQ and Near-Term Quantum) 
```

One of the best techniques to implement for NISQ systems can be achieved with the following:
- QITE implemented with error mitigation on as many qubits as possible.
